      <p>Hi there! My name is Nick Palmer and I am a third-year Computer Science & Engineering student at The Ohio State University.</p>
      <p>My interest in software development began my sophomore year of high school when I took an introduction to Java course.
        Since then, I have tried to learn about as many areas of computer science and software development as I can. Feel
        free to take a look at my project page to see some of my previous work.
      </p>

      <p>My expected graduation date is May of 2020. From there, I hope to join the industry right away to work on building
        quality software. This upcoming summer, I will be working at Honda R&D Americas in Raymond, Ohio as a Software Engineering
        Intern.</p>

      <p>My main focuses in the past have been related to web development and quality assurance.
        I hope to branch out into more areas, however, and I am always looking into opportunities to do so.</p>
