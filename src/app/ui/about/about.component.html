    <div class="animated fadeIn">
      <p>My name is Nick Palmer and I am a third-year Computer Science & Engineering student at The Ohio State University.</p>
      <p>My interest in software development began my sophomore year of high school when I took an introduction to Java course.
        Since then, I have tried to learn about as many areas of computer science and software development as I can. Feel
        free to take a look at my <a routerLink="/projects">project page</a> to see some of my previous work.
      </p>

      <p>The main focuses I have had in the past have been related to web development and quality assurance. I hope to branch
        out into more areas, however, and I am always looking into opportunities to do so.</p>

      <p>This upcoming summer, I will be working at Honda R&D Americas in Raymond, Ohio as a Software Engineering Intern. My
        expected graduation date is May of 2020. From there, I hope to join the industry right away to work on building quality
        software. </p>
