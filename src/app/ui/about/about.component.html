      <p>My name is Nick Palmer and I am a Computer Science & Engineering student at The Ohio State University.</p>
      <p>My interest in software development began my sophomore year of high school when I took an introduction to Java course.
        Since then, I have tried to learn about as many areas of computer science and software development as I can. Feel
        free to take a look at my <a routerLink="/projects">project page</a> to see some of my previous work.
      </p>

      <p>I have experienced working with various programming languages and frameworks throughout my internship experiences. 
        Through both these internships as well as my academic pursuits, I feel that I have become a much better developer since 
        starting this journey. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I will be graduating in May of 2020, and afterwards I hope to start right away with my full-time career in this industry. Please
        feel free to reach out if you know of any potential openings or would like to discuss my qualifications further.
